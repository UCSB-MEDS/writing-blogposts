# Why blog?

--
* Build your online profile/portfolio 
    
    * **"...sharing *anything* is almost always better than sharing nothing."** -[@drob](https://twitter.com/drob) in his post, [Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)

--
* Practice writing & communication skills  

--
* Stay atop DS trends  


--
* Solicit feedback from the community  


--
* Network<sup>1</sup>  

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup>Real people have gotten real jobs because the right person noticed their blog post at the right time. Lucky for sure, but not unheard of!
]

--
* Learn something new and/or solidify understanding   


--
* Combat imposter syndrome  
   
    * **"Once you've shared some analyses and code, you'll probably find that you were underrating yourself in some areas."** also -[@drob](https://twitter.com/drob) in his post, [Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)
