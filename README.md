# Creating your data science blog
**Taught by:** [@samanthacsik](https://github.com/samanthacsik)    
**Duration:** ~2 hours

Blogging about your data science adventures has **a lot** of benefits -- it can help you to build your online profile/portfolio, practice your writing and communication skills, stay atop data science trends, solicit feedback from the community, network, learn new skills and/or solidify understanding, combat imposter syndrome, etc. In this workshop, we'll learn how to add a blog to our personal website, customize posts, and (hopefully) get inspired to begin our blogging journeys!

This workshop was originally taught using the [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) framework, and now, using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Materials for both versions are linked below.
